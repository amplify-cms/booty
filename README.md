# (WIP) Booty

### Spec & Design:

- [Issue 108](https://github.com/amplify-edge/main/issues/108)

## Installation

#### Linux / Mac (amd64)

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amplify-edge/booty/master/scripts/install.sh | bash`

#### Windows (amd64) (Needs powershell)

`Invoke-WebRequest -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amplify-edge/booty/master/scripts/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression`

## Shell Completion

run

`booty completion`

or to write it to file (*nix / Darwin for example):

`booty completion > compl.bash`

it will generate your shell completion, refer to your shell documentation on how best to install it and source it on
your shell.

## Usage (for devs)

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `make all`
3. Copy the binary in `bin` directory to your `PATH`
4. Run `booty`

## Tinker Tanker

To add a component, implement the `Component`
interface in [here](https://github.com/alexadhy/booty/blob/master/dep/component.go)

This program installs config under:

- Linux: `$HOME/.local/booty/etc`
- Mac: `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/booty/etc`
- Windows: `C:\\ProgramData\booty\etc`

The file `config.reference.json` is provided as a reference should you want to change the program behaviour.

## Implemented

1. Download 3rd party binaries and libraries our project needs
2. Install said binaries
3. Also install service, managed by OS' service supervisor, preferably as user service on dev and as system-wide service
   running under unprivileged user on production.
4. Ability to run each service on the foreground like pingcap's `tiup playground`
5. Ability to self update and check for updates for third party binaries

## Short Term TODO

4. Manage configs and backups for `maintemplatev2`
